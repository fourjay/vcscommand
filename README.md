VCS wrapper

http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=90

The original seems abandoned for several years.

Forked initially to get VCSCommand User events working.

Added 'd' mapping for

    * VCSAnnotate
    * VCSLog

To 
    * Try to find a revision number in proximity of the cursor
    * then run a VCSVimDiff on the prior version
